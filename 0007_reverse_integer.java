/*
 * NOTES
 * the idea is to extract digit by digit
 * to get a single digit at a time we can use mod (%)
 * to address the overflowing, overflow must be checked before a value overflows
 * in this case, overflow occurs when the integer is outside fo the 32-bit signed integer range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1]

/*
 * Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: 123
 * Output: 321
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: -123
 * Output: -321
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: 120
 * Output: 21
 *
 * Note:
 * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’2^31,  2^31 âˆ’ 1]. For
 * the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
